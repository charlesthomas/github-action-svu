description: use https://github.com/caarlos0/svu to calculate the next semantic version for your repo by reading the commit log
inputs:
  cmd:
    description: |-
      svu sub-command
      options:
        next: prints the next version based on the git log
        major: new major version
        minor: new minor version
        current: prints current version
        prerelease: new pre release version based on the next version calculated from git log
      this github action will always run current and provide its value as an output.
      if cmd is set to current, that is all it will do.
      in all other cases, the specified sub-command will also be run and output as "next."
    required: false
    default: "next"
  clone:
    description: |-
      git clone the repo before running svu
      unnecessary if you use actions/checkout ahead of this in your workflow
    required: false
    default: false
  unshallow:
    description: |-
      run `git fetch --unshallow` before running `svu`
      useful if you use actions/checkout ahead of this in your workflow with the default depth
      ignored if clone is true
    required: false
    default: false
  pushTag:
    description: |-
      run `git tag $next && git push --tags` where `$next` is the value calculated by svu
      if the calulated new version and `svu current` are the same, nothing is pushed
  pattern:
    description: |-
      --pattern=PATTERN svu flag
      "limits calculations to be based on tags matching the given pattern"
    required: false
  prefix:
    description: |-
      --prefix svu flag
      "set a custom prefix"
      svu defaults to "v" so this action does, too
      to not use it at all, set strip-prefix to true
    required: false
    default: "v"
  stripPrefix:
    description: |-
      --strip-prefix svu flag
      "strips the prefix from the tag"
    required: false
    default: false
  buildMetadata:
    description: |-
      --build=BUILD svu flag
      "adds a build suffix to the version, without the semver mandatory plug prefix"
    required: false
    default: ""
  directory:
    description: |-
      --directory svu flag
      "specifies directory to filter commit messages by"
    required: false
    default: ""
  tagMode:
    description: |-
      --tag-mode svu flag
      "determines if latest tag of the current or all branches will be used"
    required: false
    default: "current-branch"
  forcePatchIncrement:
    description: |-
      --force-patch-increment svu flag
      "forces a patch version increment regardless of the commit message content"
      only valid if cmd is `next`
    required: false
    default: false 
  preRelease:
    description: |-
      --pre-release=PRE-RELEASE svu flag
      "adds a pre-release suffix to the version, without the semver mandatory dash prefix"
      only valid if cmd is `prerelease`
outputs:
  current:
    description: |-
      the output of `svu current` before runing `svu $cmd`, eg `svu next`
  next:
    description: |-
      the next version, if any cmd other than `current` was used
      eg `svu next`, `svu prerelease`, `svu major`, etc
  changed:
    description: |-
      whether the next version calculated by `svu $cmd` matches `svu current`
      useful if you use `svu next` without `--force-patch-increment`
      and push the tag yourself outside of this step
